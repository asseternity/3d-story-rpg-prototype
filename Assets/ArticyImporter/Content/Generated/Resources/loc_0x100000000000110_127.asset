  - Hi. Where are we?
  - Hi... I'm not too sure.
  - This is odd, isn't it?
  - I mean, it looks fairly normal. Blue sky, as one'd expect.
  - Green-colored ground to imitate grass, I get what you mean.
  - Let's explore some more. Maybe something will happen.
  - Okay!
  - Who do you think you are, coming up to me, Red, and asking your questions?
  - Ooh, look at the big Red meanie, thinking that he's too cool for school.
  - I am Circle, nice to meet you!
  - Hmph. Fine. I don't know where we are.
  - ' Do you have any guesses?'
  - I dunno. I guess we've got no choice but explore some more.
  - It must be a good place, right? Look at the bright colors!
  - It doesn't feel too good... something's off.
  - Hmm. Maybe you're right.
  - Well, is there anything you want to ask about?
  - Ugh. I don't know. What?
  - So, how's it going, Red?
  - Why do you do this, Red? Like, really?
  - Hey, what's red and bad for your health?
  - A brick!
  - Oh, god, fuck off, Circle.
  - Nah, I'm fine. See you around, Red!
  - Hmph. Fine.
  - Hi again. How are you, Blue?
  - Don't come at me with your fake niceness.
  - Huh?
  - I saw you talk to Red over there just now.
  - Bet you two were gossiping about me. Saying all kinds of nasty things.
  - I mean. Course. Everyone knows that you suck.
  - What? We didn't speak about you at all.
  - Hm....
  - Fine. But I'm watching you.
  - I knew it!
  - Fuck you too!

  - Blue
