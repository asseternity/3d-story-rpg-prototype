  - Introduction
  - Hi. Where are we?
  - Hi... I'm not too sure.
  - This is odd, isn't it?
  - I mean, it looks fairly normal. Blue sky, as one'd expect.
  - Green-coloured ground to imitate grass, I get what you mean.
  - Let's explore some more. Maybe something will happen.
  - Okay!
  - Hi again. How are you, Blue?
  - Don't come at me with your fake niceness, [PlayerInfo.PlayerName].
  - Huh?
  - I saw you talk to Red over there just now.
  - Bet you two were gossiping about me. Saying all kinds of nasty things.
  - I mean. Course. Everyone knows that you suck.
  - What? We didn't speak about you at all.
  - Hm....
  - Fine. But I'm watching you.
  - I knew it!
  - Fuck you too!
  - Who do you think you are, coming up to me, Red, and asking your questions?
  - Ooh, look at the big Red meanie, thinking that he's too cool for school.
  - I am Circle, nice to meet you!
  - Hmph. Fine. I don't know where we are.
  - ' Do you have any guesses?'
  - I dunno. I guess we've got no choice but explore some more.
  - It must be a good place, right? Look at the bright colors!
  - It doesn't feel too good... something's off.
  - Hmm. Maybe you're right.
  - Well, is there anything you want to ask about?
  - So, how's it going, Red?
  - Why do you do this, Red? Like, really?
  - Hey, what's red and bad for your health?
  - Ugh. I don't know. What?
  - A brick!
  - Oh, god, fuck off, Circle.
  - Nah, I'm fine. See you around, Red!
  - Hmph. Fine.
  - Hey, Red.
  - Oh. It's you.
  - Why are you so grumpy all the time?
  - Is it just towards me, or towards everybody?
  - Give me a break. I hate it here.
  - What's so bad about this place?
  - Ugh. Tell me about it.
  - Whoever designed it clearly needed more time to cook.
  - Um, everything?
  - The stupid walls, the creepy church, the tiny size?
  - UGH!
  - ... sorry.
  - You know what?
  - You're not so bad.
  - Finally.
  - Don't push it. See ya.
  - "Clock\u2019s broken."
  - "So\u2019s the roof."
  - You sure about this?
  - Not really.
  - You're back.
  - Didn't think you'd show.
  - It's not like I wanted to.
  - I scouted around the area.
  - It seems that we're trapped here.
  - Trapped?
  - Yes, trapped, dipshit.
  - Sorry, not in the mood today.
  - Hang in there, Red.
  - When are you ever 'in the mood'?
  - '*sigh*'
  - "Didn\u2019t think you\u2019d come."
  - "I almost didn\u2019t."
  - You still have it?
  - Never left my side.
  - Any trouble?
  - You're here.
  - "You\u2019re late."
  - Quiet.
  - All you hear is quiet.
  - Then you open your eyes.
  - Blue is next to you.
  - You okay?
  - Yeah
  - And so you start moving.
  - Circle
  - Blue
  - Red
